# Welcome to ThomasWoltjer.com

Hi! I am Thomas Woltjer, a Grand Rapids, Michigan based software engineer and award-winning composer. This site is my way of distributing my music, free of cost. Several of my works are available here, in the form of a PDF score, and FLAC audio. It might be confusing that I don't have parts publically as well, but that is very intentionally done. If you're interested in obtaining parts for anything I've written (even if it's just to try playing one of my pieces, or to practice with), simply email me at thomas@thomaswoltjer.com and I will make sure to get them to you within a few hours. The primary reason I won't post them on this site as well, is that I just want to know when people wish to play my music. My perspective on technology has brought me to the position that I don't want any sort of tracking/analytics embedded as part of this website, and the only way to understand the engagement that my music is getting is to have this sort of request system.

### Works by date (most recent first)
 
**_Viral Mutation_ (Orchestra, grade 4)**
This piece, written for advanced orchestras, tries to capture my sentiments during the period of social distancing in 2020, due to threat of sickness. It portrays the slow nature of how viruses mutate, with melodies and motives passing by each other, all the time slowly changing in themselves. Though most of the piece maintains a sense of moodiness, it ends on a high note, symbolizing the positive shifts towards of unity, love, and appreciation for each other that I saw in our society as a consequence of the pandemic.

**_Phoenix_ (Concert band, grade 3-4)**
Based on a sequence of six pitches, Phoenix is an exploration of the themes of life, death, and resurrection. This piece is intended to be rather accessible, and could be played by most high school bands. However, it does require piano and harp, so it may be challenging to put it together with a more limited instrumentation.
