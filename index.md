# Welcome to ThomasWoltjer.com

Hi! I am Thomas Woltjer, a Grand Rapids, Michigan based software engineer and award-winning composer. This site is my way of distributing my music, free of cost. Several of my works are available here, in the form of a PDF score, and FLAC audio. It might be confusing that I don't have parts publically as well, but that is very intentionally done. If you're interested in obtaining parts for anything I've written (even if it's just to try playing one of my pieces, or to practice with), simply email me at thomas@thomaswoltjer.com and I will make sure to get them to you within a few hours. The primary reason I won't post them on this site as well, is that I just want to know when people wish to play my music. My perspective on technology has brought me to the position that I don't want any sort of tracking/analytics embedded as part of this website, and the only way to understand the engagement that my music is getting is to have this sort of request system.
